## Installation

### Access the code via GitHub. Fork, clone, or download the code. This application only works using [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and requires the installation of the Sequelize package, which can be found here: [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize), and the installation of the Dotenv package which can be found here: [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).

## Usage

### This application can be used as a backend for an e-commerce website for an internet retail company. This back end uses the latest technologies so that the company can compete with other e-commerce websites.

## Credits

### Starter code was provided to me for this application. The starter code can be found here: [starter code](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/fantastic-umbrella). I used what I learned in the BootCamp Spot modules and BootCamp classes to create this application. I especially used what I learned in Module 13 and the code that was given through Module 13 as a guide for this challenge. I also referred to the Sequelize documention while working on this application: [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/core-concepts/validations-and-constraints/).
